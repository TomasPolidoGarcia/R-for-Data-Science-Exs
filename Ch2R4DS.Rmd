Basic Calculations
```{r}
1 / 200 * 30

(59 + 73 + 2) / 3

sin(pi / 2)

```

Create objects

```{r}
x <- 3 * 4
x
```

*C*ombine elements in a vector
```{r}
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

primes * 2

primes - 1
```

Names notations

i_use_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```{r}
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
this_is_a_really_long_name

r_rocks <- 2^3

seq(from =1, to = 10)
```


```{r}
x <- "Hello"
```


Exercises
1Why does this code not work?

```{r}
my_variable <- 10
my_varıable

#> Error: object 'my_varıable' not found
```
Não é o mesmo texto, ao invés do i não há o pingo

2Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```
3Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?

It shows the Keyboard Shortcut Reference. You can access it in the meny going to "Help" in the Left Up part of the screen. 

4Let’s revisit an exercise from the Section 1.6. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

```{r}
my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
my_scatter_plot
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot2.png", plot = my_bar_plot)


```

The my-bar_plot is shown, because we specified we wanted to save this plot as the second argument of ggsave
